TODO for vPause

* Backend for settings
  - I18n
* cant use Del in hotkeys
* show track time checkbox doesn't check on open
* dbk click action doesn't restore after restart

Settings:
	~ Double click action
	  next / prev / toggle repeat / to start? /
	- Checkbox: Fire hotkeys when in inputs

DONE:
x Remove button on f5, when paused & closed, navigated to another page
x Show time badge
x Hotkeys UI
x UI for settings
x Dbl click actions
x Badge on time update
x Handle tab close
x Change icons for hotkeys
x fix single-click bug
x Feedback page link
x test if "none" is working and delay is reduced
x hotkeys running on settings page

Naxt Version
	- Move player close button to left (or right when in #gp.reverse .close)
	- Icon animation
	- toggle time display: current / left / same as on the page
        - better badge display handling
